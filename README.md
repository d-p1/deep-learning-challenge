# Background 
  The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

# Overview 
  Using deep learning techniques such as predictive models, our goal is to predict whether an Organization will succeed or not succeed. We use a CSV dataset provided by the Alphabet Soup's bussiness team, containing more that 34,000 organization they are funding, in which the predicive models will output a result(successful or not successfulP.

# Results 


*Preprocessing the Data*:
 - The model's target : variable 'IS_SUCCESSFUL'
 - The model's feature(s) : APPLICATION_TYPE , 'CLASSIFICATION', 'ORGANIZATION_TYPE', 'USE_CASE'
 - 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns were both drop in the beginning due to its possible low impact on determining whether or not the organization would succeed. 

*Optimizing the Model*: 
- In order to optimize the model , we dropped a different column this time :'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS',
- noticing this variable had a lesser impact on the result.
- Focus on binning: 'APPLICATION_TYPE','CLASSIFICATION','ORGANIZATION' . This makes it easier for the predictive model to identify indicators of organizational success.
